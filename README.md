Upload ".ipynb" (code) file and then upload "kaggle.json" (datset) into google collab runtime and then run all the cells 
Executing the program without the datset image being uploaded, it shows an error at the image path cell. 
So we need to upload an image from the sample dataset and then copy the path there and run the cell again .
So for better convenience I have uploaded some of the dataset sample images from the test dataset.
